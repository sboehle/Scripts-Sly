```

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Development Phase** (Software Engineer Agent v1)
   - Implement features/fixes
   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Document changes in Memory Bank
   - Ensure quality gates pass
   - Update CHANGELOG

2. **Security & Quality Validation** (Security & QA Agent v1)
   - Execute automated security scans (SAST, dependency audit, secrets scan)
   - Perform manual security review
   - Validate quality gates and compliance
   - Conduct threat modeling and risk assessment
   - Generate comprehensive security report
   - Make production readiness decision

3. **Production Decision**
   - **PASS**: Deploy to production
   - **CONDITIONAL**: Risk acceptance required for medium severity issues
   - **FAIL**: Return to development phase for remediation

## Severity Classification & Decision Matrix

| Severity | CVSS Score | Blocker? | Decision |
|----------|-----------|----------|----------|
| Critical | 9.0-10.0 | ✅ YES | **BLOCK** - Must remediate before production |
| High | 7.0-8.9 | ✅ YES | **BLOCK** - Remediate or leadership risk acceptance |
| Medium | 4.0-6.9 | ⚠️ CONDITIONAL | **CONDITIONAL** - Remediation plan required |
| Low | 0.1-3.9 | ❌ NO | **APPROVE** - Recommendations provided |
| Info | 0.0 | ❌ NO | **APPROVE** - Optional improvements |

## Integration with Project Security Scanner

This project includes a PowerShell security scanner with 45 detection rules (PS001-PS060) covering:

### Classic Vulnerabilities (PS001-PS040)

- Code execution (Invoke-Expression, Add-Type)
- Injection attacks (SQL, command, script)
- Credential exposure
- Cryptographic weaknesses
- Network security issues

### 2025 Threat Landscape (PS041-PS060)

- AMSI bypass (PS045)
- Constrained Language Mode bypass (PS046)
- .NET reflection abuse (PS041)
- COM object exploitation (PS042)
- Token/Kerberos manipulation (PS052, PS054)
- Process injection (PS050)
- Data exfiltration (PS058-PS060)
- Event log tampering (PS053)
- LOLBins abuse (PS055)

**Scanner Location**: `scanner/Invoke-SecurityScan.ps1`  
**Rules Location**: `scanner/rules/SecurityDetectionRules.psd1`

## Memory Bank Integration

Both chat modes integrate with the Memory Bank for context awareness:

- **projectbrief.md**: Project scope and objectives
- **productContext.md**: Business context and user impact
- **systemPatterns.md**: Architecture and design decisions
- **techContext.md**: Technology stack and dependencies
- **progress.md**: Current status and completed work
- **activeContext.md**: Current work focus and recent changes
- **promptHistory.md**: Interaction tracking and decision history

## Usage Instructions
